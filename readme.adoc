== Requirements

Design and implement a RESTful API
(including data model and the backing implementation)
for money transfers between accounts.

Explicit requirements:

. keep it simple and to the point
    (e.g. no need to implement any authentication, assume the APi is
    invoked by another internal system/service)
. use whatever frameworks/libraries you like
    (except Spring, sorry!) but don't forget about the
    requirement #1
. the datastore should run in-memory for the sake of this test
. the final result should be executable as a standalone program
    (should not require a pre-installed
    container/server)
. demonstrate with tests that the API works as expected

Implicit requirements:

. the code produced by you is expected to be of high quality.
. there are no detailed requirements, use common sense.
